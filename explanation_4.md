# Active directory

## Idea

As we known, there are many levels of the hierarchy. So iteration and 
recursion can be used to tackle this situation. 

Like the hierarchy of file system, at every level of it, there are two 
types of items existed at the same place. 

Speaking back to the user group, we need to scan each levels' users 
array to ensure whether or not the target user is existed. And then, 
to access its every sub groups for the same operation until there is 
no sub group. 

## Time complexity

Suppose the average number of users in each groups is m, the depth of 
the hierarchy of user group is n.

The time complexity is O(m * n)


## Space complexity

The function of this program is to find out the specific user whether or 
not belong to the user groups. So there is no more space needed to handle 
the data generated by the program for scanning. 

The space complexity is O(1)
